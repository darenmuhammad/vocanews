If you&rsquo;re having trouble changing your habits, the problem isn&rsquo;t you.The problem is your system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bad habits repeat themselves not because you don&rsquo;t want to change but because you have the wrong system for change. This is one of the core philosophies of Atomic Habits: You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. In this book, you&rsquo;ll get a proven plan that can take you to new heights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>James Clear, one of the world&rsquo;s leading experts on habit formation, is known for his ability to distill complex topics into simple behaviors that can be easily applied to daily life and work. Here, he draws on the most proven ideas from biology, psychology, and neuroscience to create an easy-to-understand guide for making good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Along the way, readers will be inspired and entertained with true stories about Olympic gold medalists, award-winning artists, business leaders, life-saving physicians, and star comedians who have used the science of small habits to master their craft and vault to the top of their field.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Atomic Habits will reshape the way you think about progress and success and give you the tools and strategies you need to transform your habits&mdash;whether you are a team looking to win a championship, an organization hoping to redefine an industry, or simply an individual who wishes to quit smoking, lose weight, reduce stress, and achieve success that lasts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Browse our selection of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits-quotes\">best Atomic Habits quotes</a>&nbsp;or read the official&nbsp;<a href=\"https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits-summary\">Atomic Habits summary</a>&nbsp;here.</p>\r\n', '2022-12-09 07:47:11', 1, 1),

It&rsquo;s a hugely important fight for the Brit, who has not been able to put the right pieces together to get his hand raised since November 2019.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s been more than three long years since Till won a fight. That stretch has come with a lot of hardship, but Till said he&rsquo;s always kept a positive mentality, and thinks he&rsquo;s in the right spot to change his fortunes this weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a little bit of the downs and lows,&rdquo; Till told MMA Junkie. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s hard to explain what a fighter thinks about stuff like this, then when he&rsquo;s on a high. I have fought the best fighters there is to fight in the world. So, does that put me at the elite? Yes, it does. You get beat and you&rsquo;re still elite, of course. But you get beat, of course. It&rsquo;s been rough and tough.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Everything I put into this camp and I put everything into this training, as I always do. I can only go out there Saturday night and perform and stay true to my word what I said to myself all those years ago. I&rsquo;m not motivated by fame or money. I&rsquo;m motivated by something totally different. So I&rsquo;m just going to go out there and have a good fight.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an attempt to change his results, Till took his training camp to Thailand for UFC 282, leaving just one day after the birth of his daughter. He said it&rsquo;s been an effective change, because he&rsquo;s worked with the likes of Marvin Vettori and other high-quality partners in the weeks leading up to the event. It was a grueling camp, he said, but Till vows he&rsquo;s cut no corners in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been super laser focused on everything from diet to sleep to recovery,&rdquo; Till said. &ldquo;People who&rsquo;ve been with me, they&rsquo;ve been there for a reason. &hellip; I&rsquo;ve got to be ready for a guy like Dricus. He&rsquo;s a tough old cookie and he&rsquo;s f*cking coming to take some heads off.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Till is confident he&rsquo;s got the right matchup to get him back on track in Du Plessis, who is a dangerous finisher in both knockouts and submissions. Du Plessis gave Till a backhanded compliment at UFC 282 media day, stating that his opponent is among the best when he&rsquo;s firing on all cylinders, but extremely beatable when he&rsquo;s not.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That assessment isn&rsquo;t exactly incorrect, Till said, and he expects to be in his best form come fight night. If that happens, Till doesn&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll need all three rounds to get the job done.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got nothing towards Dricus,&rdquo; Till said. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel anything towards him. We&rsquo;re just going to fight. After it, I won&rsquo;t feel anything. But he&rsquo;s right in saying when I&rsquo;m on it, I&rsquo;m on it. No one can touch me. I don&rsquo;t know what it is about my striking. I just believe in it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I do believe if I touch him up a few times I&rsquo;m going to get the knockout. But I can&rsquo;t get too reckless, I can&rsquo;t do an Izzy or something. That&rsquo;s the path.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For more on the card, visit MMA Junkie&rsquo;s event hub for&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mmajunkie.usatoday.com/events/ufc-282\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"blank\">UFC 282</a>.</em></p>\r\n', '2022-12-09 04:48:55', 1, 3),

(44, 'The high-flying Pelicans are winning games with defense', 2, 'gambar-berita1670513979.jpeg', '<p><strong>Malang</strong>&nbsp;- the trio of Brandon Ingram, CJ Mc Collum&nbsp;and Zion Williamson, the&nbsp;New Orleans Pelicans&nbsp;were thought to have one of the best offenses in the league entering 2022-23. Ingram averaged nearly 24 points per game during his first two seasons in New Orleans and was at 22.7 points per game last season. McCollum has averaged at least 20 points per game in seven consecutive seasons and averaged 24.3 points in 26 games with the Pelicans after being acquired before the trade deadline. And Williamson, when healthy, has been one of the league&#39;s best offensive players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But for New Orleans to make the leap from play-in tournament team to one of the league&#39;s elite, there had to be improvement on the defensive end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Pelicans were 18th in the league last year in defensive rating, allowing 112.0 points per 100 possessions -- but that was without Williamson, who missed all of the 2021-22 season because of a broken bone in his right foot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For all his dominance on offense, Williamson had been seen as a liability at the other end during his career. In 2020-21, the Pelicans were 23rd in defensive rating (113.3) and had a 111.7 defensive rating when Williamson was on the court.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But coming into this season, there was a different vibe around Williamson and his defense, and a hope that the Pelicans could be legitimately good at that end.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;You know what I&#39;ve seen differently, especially on ball, is his defensive awareness,&quot; Ingram told ESPN prior to a preseason game against the Miami Heat. &quot;It looks like he has it in the back of his mind to have the effort on that end. That&#39;s going to be something big for our team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We know we can score the basketball. But if everybody is defending and setting examples for everybody to go out there and defend, then that&#39;s going to be much more difficult to beat us.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ingram&#39;s words have proven prophetic. The Pelicans have the third-best defensive rating in the league, helping them rise to first place in the Western Conference. And Williamson has been a big reason for the improvement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Willie Green about Williamson&#39;s defense, and he chooses to talk about the team&#39;s defensive schemes instead of individuals. When Williamson is asked directly about his defense, he chooses to turn the question back on the reporter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When Williamson came up with multiple big defensive plays against the Toronto Raptors on Nov. 30, both continued their deflections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williamson, who tied a career high with six &quot;stocks&quot; (four steals, two blocks), said he was in position at times only because of his teammates. Green said Williamson is a big part of the defense but that it was still all about the team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But at least one Pelican was willing to give Williamson the credit he&#39;d earned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Obviously I haven&#39;t seen every game he&#39;s played as a pro, but since I&#39;ve gotten here, that was the best I&#39;ve seen of him,&quot; Pelicans forward&nbsp;Larry Nance Jr. told ESPN a day after the win against the Raptors. &quot;Offensively speaks for itself, but to me defensively, four steals, two blocks, just timely, timely plays from a player that we needed it from.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nance was acquired from the&nbsp;Portland Trail Blazer&nbsp;in the trade that brought McCollum to New Orleans in February. He played just nine regular-season games last season after knee surgery but has been a big part of the Pelicans&#39; defense this season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nance has played 91% of his minutes at center in 2022-23, according to Cleaning the Glass, including 234 minutes next to Williamson in a switching scheme where the former No. 1 overall pick has thrived.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williamson has allowed 0.85 points per direct pick this season when he has been the screener defender, according to Second Spectrum tracking. That ranks sixth among 68 players to defend 200 or more picks as the screener defender this season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2020-21, Williamson allowed 0.96 points per direct pick as the screener defender, which was closer to the league average of 0.99.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Williamson has also held opponents to 37.4% shooting as the contesting defender, a mark that ranks fifth among players contesting 10 shots per game this season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;More times than not, he&#39;s going to be the guy that they bring up and try to pick on because they want to tire him out so he can&#39;t do what he can do on the offensive end,&quot; Nance said. &quot;So if we can get him to get some film out there that says like, &#39;Hey, look, I&#39;m not the one. Try anybody else but me. I&#39;m not the one.&#39; That&#39;s just going to free him up to do more on offense down the road.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nance has provided the Pelicans with a switchable center option, and they&#39;ve taken advantage of that. Overall, the Pelicans switch on 29.6% of on-ball screens (10th in the league) compared to just 19.5% last season (22nd in the league).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When starting center&nbsp;Jonas Valanciunas&nbsp;is on the court, the Pelicans are switching 18.4% of the time. When Nance is on the floor, that number jumps to 39.5%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;[Switching] provides a whole new layer of the game that their coaching staff and their players have to consider,&quot; Nance said. &quot;Some of the best switching defenses have been some of the top overall defenses in the past few years -- Boston, Golden State.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;They&#39;ve all really got players that can guard 1 through 5. And so we&#39;ve got our lineup out there of me, Z and any number of the guards that are in, cause that&#39;s who we&#39;ll switch with.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second-year forward&nbsp;Herbert Jones&nbsp;picks up the opposing team&#39;s best perimeter player night in and night out. Jones, who narrowly missed out on being named to the NBA&#39;s All-Defensive team last season as a rookie, leads the team in deflections per game, charges drawn and contested shots per game.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nance and Jose Alvarado have led the charge for the Pelicans&#39; bench units.

Brazil&#39;s jersey against Croatia&#39;s jersey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&quot;We&#39;re living in an era of homogenized kits,&quot; says John Devlin, a uniform expert and author of the book, &quot;True Colours,&quot; which explores the history of soccer jersey design. &quot;To see this array of colors is just stunning.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is. And these are, by any measure, true heavyweights. On Friday at Education City Stadium, the stands will be awash in the highest of sporting fashion: the unmistakable yellow of Brazil&#39;s globally famous canarinho shirt, pitted against the modern fascination that is Croatia&#39;s eye-popping, red-and-white checkerboard. The juxtaposition is artistically delightful - the classical splendor of a timeless look held up against the meaningful ballast of a progressive and unique sartorial statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think it&#39;s going to prove to be one of this World Cup&#39;s highlights,&quot; Devlin says. &quot;I&#39;m really looking forward to seeing this combination in action.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- World Cup 2022: News and features | Schedule</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He is not alone, though adding to the significance of the occasion is the backstories behind each of the jerseys. For both sets of fans (not to mention the players), these are not simply wearable canvases. There is real meaning behind what players are wearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aleksandar Holiga, the editor in chief of the Croatian sports website Telesport, says the link between the checkers on Croatia&#39;s uniform and its national flag is purposeful. The same Croatian painter, Miroslav Sutej, designed both (in addition to Croatia&#39;s bank notes), and for a nation that only gained its independence in 1991, that connection is a critical point of pride.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nCroatia and Brazil&#39;s kits are unique both for their color scheme and design, but their roots run a lot deeper when it comes to the countries themselves. FIFA/FIFA via Getty Images<br />\r\nCroatia&#39;s team actually debuted the jersey in 1990 - before gaining independence - in a friendly against the United States, but its popularity exploded around the world when Croatia qualified for the Euros in 1996 and then the World Cup in 1998, where Davor Suker scored six goals and won the Golden Boot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly, everyone was talking about this new country and its unforgettable jersey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I think that is the main reason [Croatians] cling to it and like it so much: it is forever associated with gaining independence and getting international recognition,&quot; Holiga says. &quot;Since the early 1990s, the checkers are everywhere in Croatia simply because they are the easiest, and coolest, way to say &#39;Croatia.&#39;&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Your guide to World Cup penalty shoot-outs: best takers in Qatar, strategies and more (E+)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pete Hoppins, who worked with both Croatia and Brazil (and many other teams) during his eight years within Nike&#39;s global football apparel group, says Croatia was also helped by the checkerboards appearing at roughly the same period as a surge in interest in replica jerseys in general. It was only in the 1990s, Hoppins says, that &quot;jerseys became a mass-market concept. And with Croatia, there&#39;s something that just feels football about its look even though its rare.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How Richarlison has cemented his spot for Brazil at the World Cup</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep dancing! Brazil won&#39;t stop celebrating with TikTok routines despite claims of &#39;disrespect&#39; Thiago Cara<br />\r\nThe appeal of Brazil&#39;s design, on the other hand, is more about branding. It&#39;s perpetually the most popular shirt in terms of global sales, Hoppins says, because &quot;people around the world, they just want to be associated with that jersey,&quot; a reference to Brazil&#39;s record five trophies at the men&#39;s World Cup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, in a classic twist, the yellow jersey -- which has come to symbolize excellence -- was actually birthed out of failure. Brazil&#39;s original kit was mostly white, but after the embarrassment of losing the 1950 World Cup at home to Uruguay, a contest was held in which Brazilians were invited to create a new design that would give the Selecao a fresh identity. &quot;Before that, people thought it wasn&#39;t a good idea to have Brazil&#39;s colors in the uniform because football didn&#39;t represent the country,&quot; says Mauricio Drumond, a sports historian and professor in Rio de Janeiro. &quot;It&#39;s obviously changed since then.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Herculez Gomez and Sebastian Salazar debate the biggest storylines and break down the best highlights that soccer in the Americas has to offer. Stream on ESPN+ (U.S. only)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The contest attracted scads of entries, and a teenager from the town of Pelotas named Aldyr Garcia Schlee, who would go on to become a renowned cartoonist, sketched over 100 different ideas before submitting his entry that would become a part of soccer&#39;s history.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Brazil became the sport&#39;s most dominant team -- winning the World Cup in 1958, 1962 and 1970 -- its yellow jersey developed into a cultural touchstone. Add in the worldwide fame of Pele, and Brazilians embraced the canarinho as a stand-in for all that was good about their nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;We don&#39;t have as many clothes with the flag on it, like you see in the United States,&quot; Drumond says. &quot;Here it&#39;s the jersey -- the Brazilian jersey represents the country... It&#39;s the flag, but in clothing.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBrazil&#39;s kits were also a symbol of the recent presidential elections, with Bolsonaro using the yellow kit as a sign of support, forcing his critics to adopt the blue jersey as a way of showing their opposition. Dado Galdieri/Bloomberg via Getty Images<br />\r\nThat reality, and the sentiments that underpin it, are not always easy. Over the past few years, the right-wing government in Brazil led by Jair Bolsonaro began using the jersey as a de facto symbol of support for the president and his way of running the country, so some citizens opposed to Bolsonaro purposely avoided wearing the jersey, saying it no longer spoke for them. Brazil&#39;s far-less-popular blue jersey became a powerful item.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Over the past few months, though, that has started to change,&quot; Drumond says, referring to the recent re-election of Lula da Silva as the country&#39;s president, as well as an overarching move to de-politicize the uniform. &quot;People began to take those symbols like the yellow jersey back,&quot; Drumond continues. &quot;As if they&#39;d been kidnapped.&quot;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has certainly been no shortage of yellow jerseys on display in Qatar, either on actual Brazilians or those fans from other countries who want to support Neymar or his teammates. Even though its design has barely changed, the canarinho has remained ubiquitous, showing up at soccer tournaments and everywhere else for decades. In fact, that consistency is part of what makes the enduring appeal of both shirts remarkable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nMost other soccer federations, obviously aware of the financial rewards that new jerseys can bring, dabble in changing colors or designs with some frequency, a practice that can result in some weird circumstances. As just one example, Spain -- whose team is known as &quot;La Roja,&quot; or &quot;The Reds&quot; -- were eliminated from the World Cup on Tuesday while wearing, for some reason, sky-blue jerseys.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Brazil and Croatia, though, such a thing feels all but impossible. Hoppins, the former Nike designer, spent plenty of time in meetings over the years discussing potential new ideas for national team uniforms, and he says everyone was always well-aware of the situation when it came time to talk about Brazil or Croatia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Every time, at every tournament, it wasn&#39;t even on the cards to not do a yellow or not do a checkerboard,&quot; Hoppins says. &quot;It&#39;s an unwritten rule. We&#39;re doing them. We all just knew it.&quot;</p>\r\n', '2022-12-08 16:39:20', 21, 2),
(46, '7 Reasons Why I Lift Heavy (And You Should Too)', 17, 'gambar-berita1670514085.jpg', '<p><strong>Malang&nbsp;</strong>- In college, I avoided the &ldquo;bro zone&rdquo; of the gym like it was a frat house after a rager. I was intimidated by the grunting, the weird machines, and the almost entirely male population outside of the cardio section and free weights. I didn&rsquo;t want anything to do with their protein shakes and bro tanks. Instead, I used the cardio machines and would do the same one to two exercises with 8-pound weights every time I went to the gym.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I really wanted to lift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A taste of CrossFit was all it took to get me addicted to lifting heavy. After a couple of months, I was lifting more weight than I thought possible. Five years later, I regularly squat more than I weigh, and 25-pound dumbbells are my go-to. Today, I feel at home under the bar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While there are great weight loss and calorie-blasting benefits of lifting heavy, it&rsquo;s not why I do it. Weightlifting makes me care more about the weight on the bar than on my body. I work hard at the gym to push my body and mind. It&rsquo;s about what my body is capable of, not what it looks like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lifting heavy, for example using a weight that you can only do 1 to 6 reps with, has made me battle the voice in my head &mdash; it&rsquo;s far more crushing than any weight could ever be. With heavy plates on the bar, there isn&rsquo;t room for self-doubt or negative thoughts. It takes all of my focus to step up, to stay in control, and to crush the lift.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weightlifting makes me feel powerful. Confident. My lifting shoes are my &ldquo;power heels.&rdquo; When I hit a big lift, I&rsquo;m unstoppable. I&rsquo;m capable of moving the weight and handling the other challenges in my life. I walk down the street knowing the physical and mental strength inside of me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lessons I have learned in the gym bleed out into the rest of my life. They have made me a faster runner, a more independent person, and a confident woman. Before you get to the heavy lifting, here are a few reasons why you should take this on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Confidence<br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s not just me. Training with heavy weights is shown to improve your self-confidence. Weight training can also reduce anxietyTrusted Source, ease depressionTrusted Source, and increase happiness. While it might be hard at times to get motivated to hit the gym, the benefits outlast the initial struggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Get going and get happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Get stronger<br />\r\nHeavy weights increase the power and strength of your muscles without significantly adding bulk or size, especially for women. This means that everyday physical tasks get easier, and consistent training will increase the amount of weight you can lift. You&rsquo;ll look stronger, too. Strength training with heavy weights enhances your muscle mass and definition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hello Michelle Obama arms and Beyonc&eacute; abs!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Cut the fat<br />\r\nEveryone knows that exercise helps you to burn more calories, but according to Mayo Clinic, a regular strength training program can also help you burn more calories when you&rsquo;re not in the gym. You get an &ldquo;after burn,&rdquo; where your body continues to use more calories in the hours following a workout. In addition to that, strength training builds muscle. That larger muscle mass increases the calories you burn daily without exercise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just like a double chocolate chip brownie, heavy strength training gives you a double reward when burning calories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Build your brain<br />\r\nHeavy weights develop more than just muscle. Lifting heavy increases the production of many hormones, including the hormone IGF-1, which helps to stimulate connections in the brain and enhance cognitive function. In a recent studyTrusted Source, leg strength was positively linked with stronger minds that are less susceptible to the negative effects of aging.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Simply stated: Strength training can improve your ability to learn and think as you age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Prevent injury<br />\r\nResistance training using body weight and with free weights, strengthens more than just your muscles. It also strengthens your bones and connective tissues. This added strength and stability will help you ward off injuries and keep a strong body. It can also help reduce symptoms of many conditions like back pain, arthritis, fibromyalgiaTrusted Source, and chronic pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this case, the game reduces the pain&shy; &mdash; the game of strength training, that is.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Improve endurance<br />\r\nIt seems counterintuitive, but strength training has been shown to improve enduranceTrusted Source, speed, and running economyTrusted Source (the amount of energy and effort it takes to do something like run a five-minute mile). A recent study showed that lifting heavier weights improves economy more than lighter weights. That extra weight on the bar will pay off during your next run or spin class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So don&rsquo;t lighten on the weights. The heavier the better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Fight aging<br />\r\nInactive adults can lose 3 to 8 percent of muscle mass per decade. You might lament the loss of your rock-hard arms or killer abs, but even worse, muscle weakness is linked with an increased likelihood of death in men. Heavy resistance training can help fight, and reverse, the loss of muscle mass. It can also strengthen bones and help prevent osteoporosis, especially in postmenopausal women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The old saying, &ldquo;Use it, don&rsquo;t lose it&rdquo; seems appropriate for your muscles.</p>\r\n', '2022-12-08 16:41:25', 19, 3),

Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a mental health condition that can cause unusual levels of hyperactivity and impulsive behaviors. People with ADHD may also have trouble focusing their attention on a single task or sitting still for long periods of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many people experience inattention and changes in energy levels. For a person with ADHD, this happens more often and to a greater extent compared with people who don&rsquo;t have the condition. It can have a significant effect on their studies, work, and home life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both adults and children can have ADHD. It&rsquo;s a diagnosis recognized by the American Psychiatric Association (APA). Learn about types of ADHD and symptoms in both children and adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nTo make ADHD diagnoses more consistent, the APA has grouped the condition into three categories, or types. These types are predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactivity-impulsive, and a combination of both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Predominantly inattentive<br />\r\nAs the name suggests, people with this type of ADHD have extreme difficulty focusing, finishing tasks, and following instructions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Experts also think that many children with the inattentive type of ADHD may not receive a proper diagnosis because they don&rsquo;t tend to disrupt the classroom. ResearchTrusted Source suggests this is more common among girls with ADHD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is the most common type of ADHD. People with this combined type of ADHD display both inattentive and hyperactive symptoms. These include an inability to pay attention, a tendency toward impulsiveness, and above-average levels of activity and energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The type of ADHD you or your child has will determine how it&rsquo;s treated. The type you have can change over time, so your treatment may change, too. Learn more about the three types of ADHD.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite how common ADHD is, doctors and researchers still aren&rsquo;t sure what causes the condition. It&rsquo;s believed to have neurological origins. Genetics may also play a role.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>ResearchTrusted Source suggests that a reduction in dopamine is a factor in ADHD. Dopamine is a chemical in the brain that helps move signals from one nerve to another. It plays a role in triggering emotional responses and movements.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other researchTrusted Source suggests a structural difference in the brain. Findings indicate that people</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There&rsquo;s no single test that can tell if you or your child has ADHD. A 2017 studyTrusted Source highlighted the benefits of a new test to diagnose adult ADHD, but many clinicians believe an ADHD diagnosis can&rsquo;t be made based on one test.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To make a diagnosis, a doctor will assess any symptoms you or your child has had over the previous 6 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your doctor will likely gather information from teachers or family members and may use checklists and rating scales to review symptoms.

(49, '14 Benefits of Strength Training', 17, 'gambar-berita1670514048.jpg', '<p><strong>Malang&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;Strength training is also known as weight training, resistance training, and muscular training.The general definition of strength training is any physical movement in which you use your body weight or equipment (e.g., dumbbells and resistance bands) to build muscle mass, strength, and endurance (1Trusted Source).There are many benefits to strength training that can improve your health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Makes you stronger<br />\r\nStrength training helps you become stronger.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Gaining strength allows you to perform daily tasks much easier, such as carrying heavy groceries or running around with your kids (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Furthermore, it helps improve athletic performance in sports that require speed, power, and strength, and it may even support endurance athletes by preserving lean muscle mass (3Trusted Source, 4Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Burns calories efficiently<br />\r\nStrength training helps boost your metabolism in two ways.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, building muscle increases your metabolic rate. Muscles are more metabolically efficient than fat mass, allowing you to burn more calories at rest (5Trusted Source, 6Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second, research shows that your metabolic rate is increased up to 72 hours after strength-training exercise. This means that you&rsquo;re still burning additional calories hours and even days after your workout (7Trusted Source, 8Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Decreases abdominal fat<br />\r\nFat stored around the abdomen, especially visceral fat, is associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases, including heart disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, type 2 diabetes, and certain types of cancer (9Trusted Source, 10Trusted Source, 11Trusted Source, 12Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple studies have shown the benefit of strength-training exercises for reducing abdominal and total body fat (13Trusted Source, 14Trusted Source, 15Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Can help you appear leaner<br />\r\nAs you build more muscle and lose fat, you will appear leaner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is because muscle is more dense than fat, meaning it takes up less space on your body pound for pound. Therefore, you may lose inches off of your waist even if you don&rsquo;t see a change in the number on the scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, losing body fat and building stronger and larger muscles showcases more muscle definition, creating a stronger and leaner appearance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Decreases your risk of falls<br />\r\nStrength training lowers your risk of falls, as you&rsquo;re better able to support your body (16Trusted Source, 17Trusted Source, 18Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, one review including 23,407 adults over the age of 60 showed a 34% reduction in falls among those who participated in a well-rounded exercise program that included balance exercises and resistance and functional training (18Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, many forms of strength training have been shown to be effective, such as tai chi, weight training, and resistance band and bodyweight exercises (19Trusted Source, 20Trusted Source, 21Trusted Source, 22Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Lowers your risk of injury<br />\r\nIncluding strength training in your exercise routine may reduce your risk of injury.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strength training helps improve the strength, range of motion, and mobility of your muscles, ligaments, and tendons. This can reinforce strength around major joints like your knees, hips, and ankles to provide additional protection against injury (1Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, strength training can help correct muscular imbalances. For example, having a stronger core, hamstrings, and glutes takes the load off of your lower back during lifting, decreasing your risk of lower-back injuries (23Trusted Source, 24Trusted Source, 25Trusted Source, 26Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, adult and teenage athletes that engage in strength training have a lower likelihood of injury (27Trusted Source, 28Trusted Source, 29Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, one review including 7,738 athletes found strength-training programs reduced the risk of injury by 33%. It was found to lower the risk of injury in a dose-dependent manner, meaning for every 10% increase in strength-training volume, there was a 4% reduced risk of injury (30Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Improves heart health<br />\r\nMultiple studies have shown that regular strength-training exercise can decrease blood pressure, lower total and LDL (bad) cholesterol, and improve blood circulation by strengthening the heart and blood vessels (31Trusted Source, 32Trusted Source, 33Trusted Source, 34Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strength training also can help you maintain a healthy body weight and manage your blood sugar levels. High blood sugar levels are a major risk factor for heart disease (31Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Helps manage your blood sugar levels<br />\r\nStrength training may lower your risk of developing diabetes and can help those with the condition manage it better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Skeletal muscle helps increase insulin sensitivity. It also reduces blood sugar levels by removing glucose from the blood and sending it to muscle cells. As a result, greater muscle mass can help improve blood sugar management (35Trusted Source, 36Trusted Source, 37Trusted Source, 38Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strength training may also reduce your risk of developing diabetes. One study following 35,754 women for an average of 10 years showed a 30% reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes among those who engaged in strength training compared with those who did not (39Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Promotes greater mobility and flexibility<br />\r\nContrary to popular belief, strength training can make you more flexible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strength training increases joint range of motion (ROM), allowing for greater mobility and flexibility. Plus, those with weaker muscles tend to have lower ROM and flexibility (40Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, a recent review comparing stretching with strength training found they were equally effective at increasing ROM (41Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For best results, ensure you&rsquo;re completing the full ROM of an exercise &mdash; in other words, utilize your full movement potential around a joint. For example, lower yourself into a squat as far as you&rsquo;re able to go without compromising your form (42Trusted Source, 43Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Boosts your self-esteem<br />\r\nStrength training can add a major boost to your self-confidence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It helps you overcome challenges, work toward a goal, and appreciate your body&rsquo;s strength. In particular, it can increase your self-efficacy &mdash; the belief that you&rsquo;re able to succeed at or perform a task &mdash; which can greatly improve your confidence (44Trusted Source, 45Trusted Source, 46Trusted Source, 47Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, one review of 7 studies in youth ages 10&ndash;16 years observed a significant association between strength training and high self-esteem, physical strength, and physical self-worth (47Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, a systematic review that studied 754 adults showed a significant link between strength training and positive body image, including body satisfaction, appearance, and social physique anxiety (the perception of judgment from others) (48Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>11. Makes your bones stronger<br />\r\nStrength training is crucial for bone development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Weight-bearing exercises put temporary stress on your bones, sending a message to bone-building cells to take action and rebuild bones stronger. Having strong bones reduces your risk of osteoporosis, fractures, and falls, especially as you age (49Trusted Source, 50Trusted Source, 51Trusted Source, 52Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately, you can reap the bone-strengthening benefits of strength training at any age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>12. Boosts your mood<br />\r\nRegular weight training may boost your mood and improve your mental health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple studies have shown that strength training may reduce anxiety and boost your mood (53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 55Trusted Source, 56Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strength training confers multiple benefits to mood regulation, such as increased self-esteem and self-efficacy. What&rsquo;s more, exercise promotes the release of mood-boosting endorphins, which can play a role in a positive mood (53Trusted Source, 54Trusted Source, 57Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>13. Improves brain health<br />\r\nThose who engage in strength training may have better brain health and protection against age-related cognitive decline.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Multiple studies in older adults have pointed to significant improvements in cognitive function (e.g., processing speed, memory, and executive function) after participating in strength training, compared with those who did not participate in it (58Trusted Source, 59Trusted Source, 60Trusted Source, 61Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s thought that resistance training has many neuroprotective effects, such as improved blood flow, reduced inflammation, and an increased expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), which is linked to memory and learning (62Trusted Source, 63Trusted Source, 64Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>14. Promotes a better quality of life<br />\r\nStrength training may increase your quality of life, especially as you age.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Numerous studies have linked strength training to increased health-related quality of life, defined as a person&rsquo;s perceived physical and mental well-being (65Trusted Source, 66Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, one review of 16 studies including adults ages 50 years and older showed a significant correlation between resistance training and better mental health, physical functioning, pain management, general health, and vitality (67Trusted Source).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What&rsquo;s more, strength training may improve quality of life in those with arthritis. One review of 32 studies showed strength training significantly improved scores in pain and physical functioning (68Trusted Source).</p>\r\n', '2022-12-09 04:47:05', 19, 1),
(50, 'MediaTek Ups Its Mobile Game With the Dimensity 9200 SoC', 3, 'gambar-berita1670512262.jpg', '<p><strong>Malang</strong>&nbsp;-&nbsp;&nbsp;The fascinating element of the Dimensity is the graphics performance improvement. This solution is one of the industry&rsquo;s first chips to take advantage of Arm&rsquo;s new Immortalis-G715 GPU, which provides hardware ray capability, one of the hottest gaming technologies in the PC and laptop arena. According to MediaTek, the Dimensity 9200&rsquo;s implementation is 32% faster than the Dimensity 9200&rsquo;s CPU while using a remarkable 41% less power.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given MediaTek&rsquo;s legacy strength in Wi-Fi and cellular connectivity, it&rsquo;s not surprising that the Dimensity 9200 shows improvement in those areas. Unlike previous generations of its mobile chips, the Dimensity 9200 incorporates both millimeter wave 5G and sub-6GHz connectivity, which will benefit those consumers seeing faster cellular data in more sections of the globe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Dimensity 9200 also provides Wi-Fi 7 support. With Wi-Fi 6 and 6E still rolling out in routers, smart home devices, and smartphones, MediaTek should be lauded for future-proofing the Dimensity 9200 with Wi-Fi 7 capability as it offers potentially game-changing latency and wireless speed advantages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another intriguing feature of the Dimensity 9200 is that the chip&rsquo;s Image 890 signal processor is the first to support RGBW camera sensors fully. These sensors not only deliver more brightness and details in images than just basic RGB, but they can also blur background images in real-time video. The demo showing this capability was one of the highlights of the announcement event.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MediaTek&rsquo;s brand is often associated with affordable, budgeted, Android phones. However, the company has made incremental inroads into the more premium, high-performance models. The launch of the MediaTek Dimensity 9200 chip is a potent step in that direction.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Like all smartphone chips, the Dimensity 9200 is a system on a chip (SoC), which means it has, among other capabilities, integrated functionality for wireless and cellular connectivity, graphics, and system performance in a single solution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similar to Apple Silicon or Qualcomm&rsquo;s Snapdragon offerings, this integrated approach facilitates smaller form factor designs which are always important in mobile devices, longer battery life, and heightened power efficiency without compromising speed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MediaTek is promoting this mobile chip as the first in the industry to utilize an Armv9 Gen 2 architecture, which requires new cores. A so-called &ldquo;big&rdquo; Cortex-X3 core manages the most arduous tasks with an assist from three Cortex-A715 performance cores.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, the 9200 incorporates four Cortex-A510 &ldquo;low-power&rdquo; cores to optimize battery life. The combination facilitates a diffident 10% to 12% performance improvement over the legacy Dimensity 9000 but supposedly reduces power consumption by a meaningful 25%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I spoke with MediaTek GM/VP of Corporate Marketing Finbarr Moynihan about the Dimensity 9200 at last week&rsquo;s launch. The following video clip highlights that conversationfdd</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are definitive signs that this strategy is working. MediaTek has been the No. 1 global smartphone chip shipment provider over the past two years. Industry reports indicate that MediaTek accounts for 37% of global smartphone chips, compared to Qualcomm&rsquo;s 28%.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Admittedly, MediaTek&rsquo;s chips don&rsquo;t appear in the sexier mobile devices people are accustomed to. Still, they provide the right mixture of performance, innovation, and affordability that appeals to increasingly &ldquo;mainstream&rdquo; consumers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During its recent analyst event in Sonoma, Calif., where it launched the Dimensity 9200, among other announcements, the company took great pains to underscore that MediaTek is &ldquo;more than mobile.&rdquo; This assertion is not surprising, as the smartphone market has dramatically softened over the last few years. After all, the company has a strong presence in routers, smart TVs, IoT, and other device categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MediaTek is not typically the company one talks about in the U.S. smartphone market, given that Apple and Qualcomm dominate the space with their respective Silicon and Snapdragon solutions. But that could change soon as MediaTek continues to grow its presence in mid- and low-end handsets.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, if the U.S. economy does fall into a recession in 2023, as many economists predict, the high-end portion of the market will likely be under tremendous pressure. MediaTek&rsquo;s strategy to push bleeding-edge technology in the more affordable mid-range section of the market could pay big dividends as consumers find it increasingly challenging to lay out $1,500 or more for the highest-end Apple iPhone or Samsung Galaxy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n', '2022-12-09 04:47:44', 20, 1),

The annual guide contains privacy reviews of more than 75 popular consumer electronics gifts and will be continuously updated throughout the giving season.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among the potential gifts in the guide thus far are the Apple Watch, Nintendo Switch, Amazon Echo, Garmin fitness trackers, Google Chromecast, Steam Deck, and the Meta Quest Pro.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Mozilla researchers, the Meta Quest Pro can be particularly challenging for privacy seekers. To get the full scoop on privacy for the gadget, a buyer would need to open at least 14 browser tabs to make sense of privacy documents totaling 37,700 words &mdash; which is about 6,747 words longer than Dickens&rsquo; &ldquo;A Christmas Carol&rdquo; and a lot less interesting to read.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meta isn&rsquo;t alone in formulating prolix privacy policies. The researchers noted that products like the Amazon Echo Dot and the Google Pixel Watch also come with multiple privacy policies for the hardware, apps, and companies they share data with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It feels like a Rube Goldberg experiment trying to navigate the privacy documentation companies throw at consumers,&rdquo; lead researcher for the guide Jen Caltrider said in a statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m struggling to understand this as a privacy researcher, consumers are far worse off. That&rsquo;s not right,&rdquo; she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;[T]he question comes down to, does Meta/Facebook have your best interests at heart when it collects all the data the Quest Pro is capable of collecting?&rdquo; Mozilla asks in its guide. &ldquo;From Cambridge Analytica to where we are today with Mark Zuckerberg&rsquo;s hopes for the metaverse, the answer to that question is a resounding NO.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meta isn&rsquo;t alone in formulating prolix privacy policies. The researchers noted that products like the Amazon Echo Dot and the Google Pixel Watch also come with multiple privacy policies for the hardware, apps, and companies they share data with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It feels like a Rube Goldberg experiment trying to navigate the privacy documentation companies throw at consumers,&rdquo; lead researcher for the guide Jen Caltrider said in a statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If I&rsquo;m struggling to understand this as a privacy researcher, consumers are far worse off. That&rsquo;s not right,&rdquo; she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, Daniel Castro, vice president of the Information Technology &amp; Innovation Foundation, a research and public policy organization in Washington, D.C., pointed out that privacy policies are often complex because digital products and services are complex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Moreover, he continued, the companies making these products face regulators not only in 50 states but all over the world. &ldquo;Given the enormous penalties these companies can face for any errors or omissions, it is not surprising that the lawyers have taken over writing these terms,&rdquo; Castro told TechNewsWorld.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Many of these privacy policies are often &lsquo;for lawyers, by lawyers&rsquo; instead of for consumers,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;These companies are not trying to deceive consumers &mdash; they are trying to avoid fines. But if they oversimplify or generalize, they will be hit with penalties like the nearly $400 million Google settlement.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malik countered that while privacy policies are important to legally protect organizations that use customer data, they should be done in a transparent and easy-to-understand manner so that people can make the decisions that are right for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;While complex policies may provide some protection from litigation, they can open up a whole new set of challenges for organizations if they are found to be deliberately obscuring how they operate from customers,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because tech companies are so concerned about privacy-related litigation with their products or services, they are inclined to write complex privacy documents that often protect their own interests at the expense of the consumer, added Mark N. Vena, president and principal analyst at SmartTech Research in San Jose, Calif.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Tech companies should be required to write more simplistic privacy documents that consumers can understand,&rdquo; Vena told TechNewsWorld. &ldquo;Apple, in particular, is very good about this in their privacy policies which are often written in easy-to-understand language.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Privacy policies should be simple and human-readable.

(52, 'GPU Wars: Assessing the Contrasting Strategies of the Market Leaders', 3, 'gambar-berita1670512276.jpg', '<p><strong>Malang&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;Thanks largely to Nvidia, GPUs have nearly eclipsed CPUs as the technology driving advancement. When it comes to AI, particularly on the training side, GPUs reign supreme. Generally, GPUs make our games and most advanced photo and video editing tools work better as well &mdash; and with social media, many folks are becoming creation experts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But while AMD, Nvidia, and, most recently, Intel have played in this highly competitive space, all three have come to market lately with distinctive strategies, each with unique benefits, risks, and opportunities. As we recover from our Thanksgiving food comas here in the U.S., let&rsquo;s explore these strategies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll then close with my product of the week: the new Arm-based Surface Pro 9 from Microsoft that may point to the near-term future of PC advancement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketing Strategies: Apple Example<br />\r\nMy first degree was in merchandising, which has to do with branding, shelving, product placement, and product strategy. As a result, I&rsquo;m a bit fascinated by how different companies approach the PC market.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance, Apple is old-school, vertically integrated, and uses lock-in to mine its base for money. This tactic results in massive profits, but the company is no longer able to lead the market with innovation. Granted, public companies are measured by profits, not innovation, and if you had to choose one over the other as a CEO who wanted to keep your job, profits would be your focus as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other PC companies, except for Microsoft Surface, are more eclectic, have high interoperability, no lock-in, and enjoy far greater innovation but suffer lower customer loyalty and smaller margins. But they are also less likely to catastrophically fail because they aren&rsquo;t mining their customers for money.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IBM&rsquo;s near collapse in the early 1990s was mainly due to a similar strategy to Apple&rsquo;s. It occurred because customers typically don&rsquo;t like funding excessive profits or being mined for money. Eventually, the company using this approach goes too far, and its customers abandon the platform. That&rsquo;s what almost happened to IBM and caused it to scrap with prejudice the strategy Apple still uses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For now, the strategy still works for Apple. However, it likely wouldn&rsquo;t work for Dell, HP, or Lenovo, because none of those companies individually could do the Microsoft part of the solution and because their enterprise buyers are aware of the strategy Apple is using and generally attempt to avoid it like the plague &mdash; because it reduces buyer power and corporations like buyer power a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having said that, while Apple&rsquo;s marketing efforts have significantly declined since Steve Jobs&rsquo; departure both in magnitude and execution, Apple still leads the PC market in marketing, showcasing how far ahead it once was under Jobs, even though the company was far less profitable back then.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Marketing goes to the core of the GPU strategies we will be discussing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nvidia<br />\r\nNvidia is arguably the segment leader and showcases this with the deepest line, and it&rsquo;s the only one of the three with a halo product. This is interesting because AMD&rsquo;s Threadripper on the CPU side spun that market on its ear and allowed AMD to move aggressively on Intel&rsquo;s workstation opportunity. It took over key leadership positions for AMD and Lenovo, using the part to gain segment dominance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the GPU side, the closest thing to AMD&rsquo;s Threadripper is Nvidia&rsquo;s 4090 RTX card, which is a beast. It has more performance than most need and pulls so much power it has been melting power connectors and forcing power supply upgrades to run the part. But, in terms of raw performance, nothing can touch it now in its segment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A halo strategy uses an expensive showcase product to draw people to the brand and, if done correctly, can drive increased sales to the more affordable products that will sell in higher volumes. In the automobile market, this is like having a Mercedes-Maybach or supercar (Ford used the Ford GT most recently for this) to drive people into dealerships.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since there is no such thing as an Nvidia store, the traffic aspect of the 4090 RTX is untested and unused. However, it still gives Nvidia performance bragging rights and solidifies its perceived market leadership even though most buyers will buy more affordable and less power-hungry alternatives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AMD<br />\r\nAs noted, it&rsquo;s interesting that, given AMD&rsquo;s success with Threadripper, it hasn&rsquo;t come up with a similar strategy given the killer workstation or gaming rig would have a Threadripper CPU and a Threadripper-like GPU. For now, it is that Nvidia 4090 RTX card.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, AMD has brought out two cards in the performance sweet spot. In contrast to what Ford did with the Ford GT, this is more like what GM did with the Corvette, particularly the new C8. It provides most performance benefits that the Ford GT provides in a far more useful and affordable fashion, allowing the Corvette to massively outperform the Ford GT in volume while costing a fraction of what Ford costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The idea of the performance you need at a price you can afford does resonate with buyers and doesn&rsquo;t create some of the image problems that a halo product can cause, such as exorbitant cost and excessive power use, which can result in negative coverage on sustainability.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Buyers do like values, and while you don&rsquo;t get the same performance bragging rights or visibility as you would with a halo product, you also don&rsquo;t have issues with a part that is pushing performance limitations which can result in problems like the melting connectors (which Nvidia reports are still low numbers and may be the result of assembly errors).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intel<br />\r\nIntel is new to this market and has two big problems. The first is that people know and trust the GPU parts from AMD and Nvidia, and the second is that those two companies are chasing each other so hard it is nearly impossible for another firm to catch them from behind. Intel needs to carve out part of the market and doesn&rsquo;t have the performance for the top end, but it can deliver on features.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The approach is close to how Honda entered the car market by creating an affordable part that provided features beyond its price class and headed for where the real volume is, particularly during a tightening financial market where consumers are watching their pennies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right now, folks are becoming very thrifty, and Intel is playing hard for that frugal buyer who only has a budget for an entry-level part. Intel&rsquo;s cards aren&rsquo;t performance competitive with Nvidia and AMD&rsquo;s top offerings, but they cost a fraction of the price and have many of the same core features, features that typically are not in cards in Intel&rsquo;s sub-$300 price class.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wrapping Up: The Best Strategy<br />\r\nThe plan of action that best reflects the vendor&rsquo;s capabilities is the one to implement. The halo product strategy works for Nvidia because it must preserve the impression it&rsquo;s the performance leader in the segment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Given AMD&rsquo;s Threadripper success, I remain surprised that AMD hasn&rsquo;t rolled out a similar strategy. Still, its approach to providing all the performance you need and creating the impression it&rsquo;s the better performance value is consistent with the historic brand image that AMD created against Intel, where it was historically the value play.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Intel doesn&rsquo;t yet have the performance to compete with AMD or Nvidia at the high end, but it has a similar feature set, and the idea of providing a value play is the only path open to it. The timing was fortuitous for Intel because the market is looking for high values given current economic conditions, which should give the Intel approach a significant boost.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, Intel&rsquo;s approach is not the only one the company can currently execute. Luckily, it was incredibly well-timed, suggesting it will be far more successful this year than it otherwise would have been.</p>\r\n', '2022-12-08 16:11:16', 21, 3),
(53, 'Piracy Expert Sees Weaponization of Legit Video Providers on the Rise', 3, 'gambar-berita1670512287.jpg', '<p><strong>Malang&nbsp;</strong>-&nbsp;Streaming video content from non-mainstream providers might make you an unwitting target of content piracy. If you get a bargain pricing offer, at first you might not care. But you stand a chance of becoming the victim of scammers and hackers, losing personal data, and having your financial assets stolen. That amounts to a hefty financial loss for consumers and legitimate creative content providers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Paying low-balled sign-up fees is often the first sign that you are dealing with an illegitimate media operation. Most people do not realize bad actors can easily steal legitimate creative content to make heaps of money. The thefts occur by using content operators&rsquo; mobile apps or content delivery systems against them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This process turns participating consumers into a weapon that can dramatically hurt businesses&rsquo; profits and lead to fewer legit subscribers, warns Asaf Ashkenazi, CEO at Verimatrix, a long-time security specialist for the media and entertainment industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This digital piracy operation is becoming widespread in the video content space. Its newfound weaponization is harmful to legitimate retailers and advertisers and a growing threat to Hollywood and other sectors, such as sports and entertainment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is very difficult to quantify the extent of piracy today. But it is much wider than people think,&rdquo; Ashkenazi told TechNewsWorld.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Video Piracy Mitigation<br />\r\nVerimatrix is a cybersecurity company based in California, with offices in Europe, that tracks application streams and website traffic. Its twofold mission is to protect enterprise applications in mobile phones and provide anti-piracy services to businesses.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The insight Ashkenazi shared about this new approach to video piracy comes from unexpected discoveries of digital traffic patterns while monitoring clients&rsquo; networks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His company monitors what hackers do online with developed tools that can identify patterns that indicate an attack is imminent so it can be minimized or thwarted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The specialized cyber defenses protect automotive firms, banks, and enterprises from data loss through their apps. The client base totals about 300 customers around the world, noted Ashkenazi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Insider&rsquo;s View<br />\r\nThe cyber firm&rsquo;s CEO verbalized a philosophy that is a bit unique for a digital sleuth. He openly professes a belief that you can never entirely prevent digital content from being leaked.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, Verimatrix developed proprietary technology services that disrupt the pirates&rsquo; business model. The goal is to take down a rogue service fast. When possible, they work to extract the intrusion from the video delivery pipelines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If we can make it more difficult for the pirates to grab subscribers&rsquo; data and force them to spend more money to continue their operations, they will not make enough money. Then they do not go after our customers,&rdquo; he explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, suppose the cyber defenses can cut out the illegal delivery network connections after 10 minutes. In that case, the illegitimate pirate users will not be able to watch the sporting event for which they paid, Ashkenazi explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In addition, all of the ad revenue and continued subscription payments no longer get to the pirate streaming service. This will put them out of business,&rdquo; he continued.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From File Sharing to Outright Theft<br />\r\nAshkenazi finds the evolution of digital piracy an interesting progression. The perpetrators moved file-sharing exploits to advanced new technologies, and they learned to adjust techniques along the way to become modern-day content pirates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;They are no different than any other thieves. How the digital criminals evolved with technology is really, really fascinating,&rdquo; he offered.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the past, it was more organized enterprises that were doing it. The activity focused on a lot of file sharing. Much of it centered on The Pirate Bay, which launched in 2003 but mostly involved people sharing content with their peers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ashkenazi submitted that when people used the file-sharing network, they knew they were doing something illegal. Duped subscribers to pirated video streaming networks today do not even know they are dealing with an illegal operation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When we moved to streaming, pirates moved and became a much more organized group that provided services. And what we see is that these services are more and more looking like legitimate services that provide better user experience than what the legitimate providers are providing,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The pirates are aggregating content coming from different suppliers. They present a one-stop video shop with a very good experience. It is becoming a very lucrative business, he added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monetizing Hacked Video Delivery<br />\r\nThis begs the question: how do they make money? They make money in three ways, often maximizing two or all three approaches in the same video streaming event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first method is very straightforward. The rogue business looks like a well-cured legitimate service. The scam includes offering a much lower subscription price than what lawful content streaming services charge. Because the thieves do not have to pay a source for the content, everything is a profit for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today video pirates gain access to content distribution with very sophisticated high-tech equipment. In the beginning, they were stealing the content and re-streaming it, according to Ashkenazi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>They now have ways to connect and inject their content through legitimate suppliers and stream it for free. The pirating operation lets their unaware subscribers connect to the same delivery system that the honest services use.</p>\r\n', '2022-12-09 04:52:46', 19, 2),

It added that Facebook&rsquo;s parent company Meta promotes them as a &ldquo;one-stop shop&rdquo; for advertising and marketing on its platforms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report contended that the accounts are particularly valuable to scammers because business managers can run a series of ad campaigns and easily add new users and ad accounts to expand their reach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the Facebook groups examined by TTP, the group noted that users frequently sell accounts in bulk quantities. Many of the accounts come linked to someone&rsquo;s credit card, it continued, indicating they were hacked or stolen. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s obviously a big problem for individual users or small businesses that suddenly have an unauthorized person racking up big charges on their card,&rdquo; Paul said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The report also found that in some cases, sellers offer accounts approved to advertise political, election, and social issues.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fake Accounts, Real Revenue<br />\r\nSome critics of Facebook have suggested that the social network has taken a light touch to fraudulent accounts because they produce revenue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;These black-market business manager accounts are approved to advertise on Facebook. That means that Facebook profits every time the buyers of these illicit accounts run ads on the platform,&rdquo; Paul said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This raises new questions about how much of Facebook&rsquo;s advertising revenue is coming from hacked, stolen, or trafficked ad accounts,&rdquo; she added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While acknowledging that Facebook can make money off fraudulent accounts, Will Duffield, a policy analyst with the Cato Institute, a Washington, D.C. think tank, pointed out that fake accounts don&rsquo;t produce as much revenue as legitimate ones.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s some incentive not to poke too much at the problem, but from the business side, each black market account means there&rsquo;s a business customer who is dissatisfied because they&rsquo;ve had their account stolen,&rdquo; Duffield told TechNewsWorld.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If legitimate accounts are being stolen and turned into black market accounts, that&rsquo;s not good for Facebook,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Platform for Election Interference<br />\r\nAccording to the TTP report, Facebook has had a longstanding problem with accounts being hijacked to run scam ads using people&rsquo;s credit card information. It&rsquo;s easy to see how business manager accounts could be useful to scammers, the report continued, given their ability to run multiple ad campaigns simultaneously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It added that owners of business manager accounts have frequently recounted how hackers commandeered their accounts, raising their billing threshold to rack up thousands of dollars in spending on scam ads that direct people to questionable e-commerce websites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The TTP&rsquo;s investigation also found sellers offering accounts that can run ads on social issues, elections, or politics. That raises concerns they could be used for coordinated inauthentic activity and election interference, the report noted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Challenging Task<br />\r\nControlling disinformation on Facebook is a challenging problem, maintained Vincent Raynauld, an associate professor in the Department of Communication Studies at Emerson College in Boston.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Identifying and suppressing disinformation is extremely hard for Facebook because the manifestation of disinformation on these platforms keeps evolving,&rdquo; Raynauld told TechNewsWorld.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;If Facebook establishes a filter to catch certain kinds of disinformation, the producers of the disinformation will adjust the structure of it so it will evade the filter and have an impact on the public conversation,&rdquo; he explained.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Issues like hijacked accounts have always been a part of Facebook, he added, but the overall weight of Facebook, when it comes to its impact on disinformation and political processes, is making these types of issues ever more important to the public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Social media has become an integral part of people&rsquo;s daily lives, especially when it comes to acquiring information that influences not only consumer decisions but political decisions, as well,&rdquo; he added.</p>\r\n', '2022-12-08 16:23:16', 2, 3),

Bout has maintained he is innocent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Kremlin has long called for his release, slamming his sentencing in 2012 as &ldquo;baseless and biased.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Griner &ndash; who had for years played in the off-season for a Russian women&rsquo;s basketball team &ndash; was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region in February. Despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in Mordovia in mid-November after losing her appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Griner&rsquo;s family had urged the White House to secure her release, including via prisoner exchange if necessary. At the center of their bid was Bout, a man who eluded international arrest warrants and asset freezes for years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Russian businessman, who speaks six languages, was arrested in a sting operation in 2008 led by US drug enforcement agents in Thailand posing as the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, known by the acronym FARC. He was eventually extradited to the US in 2010 after a protracted court proceeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Viktor Bout has been international arms trafficking enemy number one for many years, arming some of the most violent conflicts around the globe,&rdquo; said Preet Bharara, the US attorney in Manhattan when Bout was sentenced in New York in 2012.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He was finally brought to justice in an American court for agreeing to provide a staggering number of military-grade weapons to an avowed terrorist organization committed to killing Americans.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The trial honed in on Bout&rsquo;s role in supplying weapons to FARC, a guerrilla group that waged an insurgency in Colombia until 2016. The US said the weapons were intended to kill US citizens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Bout&rsquo;s history in the arms trade extended much further afield. He has been accused of assembling a fleet of cargo planes to traffic military-grade weapons to conflict zones around the world since the 1990s, fueling bloody conflicts from Liberia to Sierra Leone and Afghanistan. Allegations of trafficking activities in Liberia prompted US authorities to freeze his American assets in 2004 and blocked any US transactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bout has repeatedly maintained that he operated legitimate businesses and acted as a mere logistics provider. He is believed to be in his 50s, with his age in dispute because of different passports and documents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;His early days are a mystery,&rdquo; Douglas Farah, a senior fellow at the International Assessment and Strategy Center who co-authored a book on Bout, told CNN in 2010.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Farah told Mother Jones magazine in 2007 that according to his multiple passports, Bout was born in 1967 in Dushanbe, Tajikistan, the son of a bookkeeper and an auto mechanic. He said that Bout graduated from the Military Institute on Foreign Languages, a well-known feeder school for Russian military intelligence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He was a Soviet officer, most likely a lieutenant, who simply saw the opportunities presented by three factors that came with the collapse of the USSR and the state sponsorship that entailed: abandoned aircraft on the runways from Moscow to Kiev, no longer able to fly because of the lack of money for fuel or maintenance; huge stores of surplus weapons that were guarded by guards suddenly receiving little or no salary; and the booming demand for those weapons from traditional Soviet clients and newly emerging armed groups from Africa to the Philippines,&rdquo; Farah told the magazine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bout has said that he worked as a military officer in Mozambique. Others have said it was actually Angola, where Russia had a large military presence at the time, Farah told CNN. He first became known when the United Nations began investigating him in the early-to-mid 1990s and the United States began to get involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bout &ndash; who reportedly has used names including &ldquo;Victor Anatoliyevich Bout,&rdquo; &ldquo;Victor But,&rdquo; &ldquo;Viktor Butt,&rdquo; &ldquo;Viktor Bulakin&rdquo; and &ldquo;Vadim Markovich Aminov&rdquo; &ndash; is thought to have been the inspiration for the arms-dealer character played by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 movie &ldquo;Lord of War.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2002, CNN&rsquo;s Jill Dougherty met with Bout in Moscow. She asked him about allegations against him &ndash; did he sell arms to the Taliban? To al Qaeda? Did he supply rebels in Africa and get paid in blood diamonds? &ndash; and he denied each claim.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a false allegation and it&rsquo;s a lie,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never touched diamonds in my life and I&rsquo;m not a diamond guy and I don&rsquo;t want that business.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not afraid,&rdquo; he told Dougherty. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t do anything in my life I should be afraid of.&rdquo;</p>\r\n', '2022-12-08 16:10:19', 1, 2);

The swap did not include another American that the State Department has declared wrongfully detained, Paul Whelan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s safe, she&rsquo;s on a plane, she&rsquo;s on her way home,&rdquo; Biden said at the White House Thursday morning alongside Griner&rsquo;s wife, Cherelle. &ldquo;After months of being unjustly detained in Russia, held under untolerable circumstances, Brittney will soon be back in the arms of her loved ones, and she should have been there all along.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden acknowledged that Griner&rsquo;s release was occurring while Whelan remained imprisoned, saying that Whelan&rsquo;s family &ldquo;have to have such mixed emotions today.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This was not a choice of which American to bring home,&rdquo; Biden said. &ldquo;Sadly, for totally illegitimate reasons, Russia is treating Paul&rsquo;s case differently than Brittney&rsquo;s. And while we have not yet succeeded in securing Paul&rsquo;s release, we are not giving up. We will never give up.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden said efforts to bring Griner home took &ldquo;painstaking and intense negotiations&rdquo; as he thanked members of his administration who were involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is a day we&rsquo;ve worked toward for a long time. We never stopped pushing for her release,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asked when Griner would be home following his remarks, Biden indicated it would be in the next &ldquo;24 hours.&rdquo; As for what he would say to Whelan&rsquo;s family, he said, &ldquo;We&rsquo;re speaking to them.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cherelle Griner thanked the administration for helping secure her wife&rsquo;s release and said she was &ldquo;overwhelmed with emotions.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both she and Brittney Griner &ldquo;will remain committed to the work of getting every American home, including Paul, whose family is in our hearts today,&rdquo; she added.Brittney Griner &ndash; who, for years, had played in the off-season for a Russian women&rsquo;s basketball team &ndash; had been detained since February, when she was arrested on drug smuggling charges at an airport in the Moscow region. Despite her testimony that she had inadvertently packed the cannabis oil that was found in her luggage, she was sentenced to nine years in prison in early August and was moved to a penal colony in the Mordovia republic in mid-November after losing her appeal.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden gave final approval for the prisoner swap freeing Griner over the past week, an official familiar with the matter said, adding that Biden was updated on the swap as it was taking place Thursday morning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He was briefed throughout the morning as he awaited confirmation that Griner was back in US hands, a US official says. Once that happened, Biden spoke with Griner from the Oval Office, with Cherelle Griner, Vice President Kamala Harris and Secretary of State Antony Blinken was also on the call, a second official said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Biden was &ldquo;personally involved and in constant touch&rdquo; with his team as this deal came together in the final days and after he gave his personal green light to execute the trade. The briefings &ndash; and questions Biden asked his team &ndash; were constant, a senior administration official says.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The official added that this was the right deal to make, but notably said this was &ldquo;the only deal we could make right now.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Russians signaled recently that they were only willing to negotiate for Griner and not Whelan, a US official said. That is because Russia has been handling their cases differently based on what each has been accused of.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Biden administration repeatedly made offers to get Whelan released as part of this deal, even after Russia made clear only Griner was acceptable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the end, when it was clear Russia was going to refuse on Whelan, the US had to accept it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It was a choice to get Brittney or nothing,&rdquo; the US official said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The official says that was a &ldquo;difficult decision&rdquo; for Biden but again, one he felt he had to make.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whelan, a US, Irish, British and Canadian citizen, was detained at a Moscow hotel in December 2018 by Russian authorities who alleged he was involved in an intelligence operation. He was sentenced to 16 years in prison on espionage charges he has vehemently denied. Whelan had been carrying out his sentence at a different labor camp in Mordovia, an eight-hour drive from Moscow, where he told CNN in June 2021 he spent his days working in a clothing factory that he called a &ldquo;sweatshop.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whelan&rsquo;s family expressed happiness at the news that Griner is on her way home but said Thursday they are &ldquo;devastated&rdquo; that he was left behind.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great day for the families of the wrongfully detained and we feel wonderful for them,&rdquo; David Whelan, Paul&rsquo;s brother, said on &ldquo;CNN This Morning.&rdquo; &ldquo;But we do worry about what&rsquo;s in Paul&rsquo;s future. I think it&rsquo;s become clear that the US doesn&rsquo;t have any concessions that the Russian government wants for Paul. So I&rsquo;m not really sure what the future holds.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Biden administration told Whelan&rsquo;s family ahead of the Griner announcement, David Whelan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In an email to the media, David Whelan said his family was &ldquo;devastated&rdquo; at the news and increasingly worries that Paul won&rsquo;t survive the rest of his sentence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t even fathom how Paul will feel when he learns. Paul has worked so hard to survive nearly four years of this injustice. His hopes had soared with the knowledge that the US government was taking concrete steps for once towards his release. He&rsquo;d been worrying about where he&rsquo;d live when he got back to the US,&rdquo; David Whelan said in his statement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;And now what? How do you continue to survive, day after day, when you know that your government has failed twice to free you from a foreign prison? I can&rsquo;t imagine he retains any hope that a government will negotiate his freedom at this point. It&rsquo;s clear that the US government has no concessions that the Russian government will take for Paul Whelan. And so Paul will remain a prisoner until that changes,&rdquo; Whelan said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bout has returned home to Russia, the Russian foreign ministry. The prisoner exchange with Griner was &ldquo;completed successfully at Abu Dhabi Airport&rdquo; on Thursday, state media added.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bout, nicknamed the &ldquo;Merchant of Death,&rdquo; is a former Soviet military officer serving a 25-year prison sentence in the United States on charges of conspiring to kill Americans, acquire and export anti-aircraft missiles, and provide material support to a terrorist organization.

The FBI has joined the hunt for answers into how attacks on substations left around 40,000 without power over the weekend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a Sunday news conference, the county sheriff described the attacks as &ldquo;intentional&rdquo; and &ldquo;targeted,&rdquo; but had no reason why the person or persons involved would choose the place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What authorities are saying<br />\r\nCNN&rsquo;s Whitney Wild, reporting from Moore County, mentioned online rumors that disrupting a drag show planned for Saturday night may have been the cause of the attack, but authorities have not confirmed that and said no person or group has claimed responsibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What authorities have confirmed is that someone or some people removed a gate at one substation from its hinges. The damage to transformers was apparently caused by gunfire, although it&rsquo;s not clear what kind of weapon was used.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the roughly 40,000 people who lost power aren&rsquo;t expected to get it back until Thursday, according to Duke Energy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Life without power is causing problems<br />\r\nMike Cameron is the assistant town manager and fire chief of Southern Pines, North Carolina, which is in Moore County.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Appearing on CNN on Monday, he said medical calls have increased as people who rely on oxygen and plug-in medical devices struggle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In temperatures that have dipped almost to freezing overnight, people have gotten creative to heat their homes, which has led to an increase in calls about house fires.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There has also been an increase in emergency calls about traffic accidents, &ldquo;just because our traffic lights are obviously not working,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It is just a horrible, horrible terrorist, in my opinion, act. Cowardly,&rdquo; she told CNN&rsquo;s Victor Blackwell on Monday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The mayor of Pinehurst, North Carolina, John Strickland, said on CNN that investigators will have to determine if this was a targeted attack by domestic extremists, but he said it was meant to be destructive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;This is clearly an act that was intentional, very forceful and an act of vandalism to create a situation where the citizens of Pinehurst and Moore County are lacking heat and other support services at the present time,&rdquo; he said on &ldquo;CNN Newsroom.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>FirstHealth Moore Regional Hospital is currently being powered by diesel fuel, according to its president, Jonathan Davis, but elective procedures have been delayed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The power grid is an &lsquo;attractive target&rsquo;<br />\r\nCNN&rsquo;s chief law enforcement and intelligence analyst John Miller said this type of attack has long been feared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American electrical grid is decentralized and controlled by a hybrid of public and private entities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The challenge is most of these places are outdoors, most are in remote areas and most of them are available for attack from a long distance,&rdquo; Miller said on &ldquo;CNN This Morning.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>He also noted there has been an uptick in chatter among various anti-government and ecoterrorist groups who consider attacks on the electrical infrastructure as a way to create chaos in the US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The aim may be chaos<br />\r\nIn particular, Miller said right wing neo-Nazi groups have suggested creating a chain reaction of attacks to systematically take down the power grid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Their theory is that if you identify the key nodes and you knock out one and they divert power to the next one, and you knock out the next one and the next one, a domino effect can actually start to topple the national grid and plunge the nation into darkness and chaos,&rdquo; Miller said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s obviously not clear if this North Carolina attack is anything along those lines, but the Department of Homeland Security has been warning about such attacks for some time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Attacks on power substations are not unprecedented<br />\r\nSniper fire hit a Silicon Valley substation in April 2013, when 150 rounds from an assault rifle took out 17 transformers. Workers rerouted power in that case, but repairs to the transformers took nearly a month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Miller said that after that incident, power companies and the government undertook a systemic review of grid security and made changes to add more cameras and motion sensors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In January 2022, CNN&rsquo;s Geneva Sands reported on a DHS memo about potential electrical grid threats from extremist groups angry at the outcome of the 2020 presidential election.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Violent extremist groups have identified the electrical grid as a &ldquo;particularly attractive target,&rdquo; according to the intelligence bulletin, and have drawn up specific plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October 2020, the memo noted, White supremacists in Idaho were charged with conspiracy for trying to damage transformers in that area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, in May 2020 the government charged followers of the Boogaloo movement, which believes there is a civil war coming, for allegedly conspiring to attack a substation in Las Vegas. Their larger goal was to incite riots and violence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unsophisticated small-scale attacks are unlikely to cause the kind of large-scale meltdown that anti-government plotters envision, but they are likely to cause substantial harm and expensive damage &ndash; which is precisely what&rsquo;s happening in Moore County.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Possible scenarios<br />\r\nJuliette Kayyem, a CNN analyst and the former assistant secretary for intergovernmental affairs at DHS, said on CNN&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Lead&rdquo; that investigators are probably looking at three possible scenarios:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foreign attack.

The move came after Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus R. Vance Jr. acknowledged deep flaws in the decades-old prosecution and said &ldquo;it was clear these men did not receive a fair trial.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Who was Malcolm X?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malcolm X was an African American religious leader and civil rights activist who spoke about the need for Black empowerment and advocated for the adoption of Islam within the Black community as a spokesman for the Nation of Islam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During his time, he was a controversial figure among White and Black Americans alike for speaking out vociferously against the racism of White people &mdash; famously referring to them as &ldquo;blue-eyed devils&rdquo; &mdash; and arguing for the creation of a Black separatist society. But the same outspoken stance against the brutal treatment of Black people during that era made him a hero to many, especially African Americans in the North. Malcolm X&rsquo;s advocacy has been celebrated again in recent years amid high-profile killings of Black people by White police officers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And yet, as with his more tempered counterpart in the South, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X&rsquo;s views changed over his short lifetime. After leaving the Nation of Islam in 1964, Malcolm X traveled throughout Africa and underwent a transformation as he encountered Muslims of all races. He abandoned the Nation&rsquo;s virulently anti-White ideology and converted to Sunni Islam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>His international ambitions, which included charging the United States with human rights violations against African Americans at the United Nations, drew the ire of the U.S. government, according to Les Payne and Tamara Payne in the book &ldquo;The Dead Are Arising.&rdquo; He also became a growing threat to his former mentor, Nation of Islam leader Elijah Muhammad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Why did Malcolm X break with the Nation of Islam?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malcolm X had learned of Elijah Muhammad&rsquo;s affairs with women in the Nation and his many illegitimate children and, disenchanted with the leader&rsquo;s moral character and hypocrisy, began sharing this knowledge within the Nation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the wake of President John F. Kennedy&rsquo;s assassination on Nov. 22, 1963, Malcolm X gave Muhammad an opening to oust him. In a speech in Manhattan, Malcolm X called the murder &ldquo;a case of the chickens coming home to roost.&rdquo; Muhammad, who had forbidden his members to speak about the assassination, suspended Malcolm for 90 days, with no plans to reinstate him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In March 1964, Malcolm X announced that he was leaving the Nation to start Muslim Mosque Inc. A few months later, he founded the Organization of Afro-American Unity to encourage oppressed Black people around the world to join forces. He also began divulging Muhammad&rsquo;s secrets in public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rumors that the Nation was plotting to murder him did not escape him. &ldquo;I live like a man who is dead already,&rdquo; he told reporters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Where and how was Malcolm X assassinated?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Malcolm X was assassinated at age 39 as he was preparing to give a speech at the Audubon Ballroom in Manhattan on Feb. 21, 1965. As he greeted his audience from the podium, there was a commotion in the back of the room.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Get your hands out of my pocket,&rdquo; a man shouted. The man struck a match and lit a rolled-up sock, throwing the makeshift smoke bomb onto the auditorium floor. Malcolm X shifted his attention to the ruckus. Two security men in front of the stage moved toward the disturbance, deserting their posts. Members of the audience turned their heads. Malcolm X raised his arms and stepped back from the wooden podium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Now, now, brothers break it up,&rdquo; he said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An assassin wielding a sawed-off shotgun rushed to the podium, aimed at Malcolm&rsquo;s chest and pulled the trigger. Malcolm X fell.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, two accomplices dashed to the edge of the stage, shooting Malcom X in the ankle and both of his thighs. The three gunmen turned to retreat through the chaos of the crowd. Two managed to escape the ballroom, but a Malcolm X bodyguard shot one attacker in the thigh. Meanwhile on the stage, undercover New York police officer Gene Roberts, who had been working as a part of Malcolm X&rsquo;s security detail, tried unsuccessfully to revive Malcolm X. Japanese American activist Yuri Kochiyama famously cradled the leader&rsquo;s head.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The circumstances of the civil rights leader&rsquo;s death have long been the subject of controversy, well-founded skepticism and conspiracy theories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The man who was shot by the bodyguard in the thigh and captured, Talmadge Hayer, also known as Thomas Hagan and Mujahid Abdul Halim, confessed to the killing and is imprisoned. Yet since his 1966 trial, he has maintained that the other two Nation members convicted in the murder &mdash; Muhammad A. Aziz, who previously went by the name Norman 3X Butler, and Khalil Islam, who previously went by Thomas 15X Johnson &mdash; were innocent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1977, Hayer fingered the four men by name whom he alleged acted with him: the two other gunmen and two accomplices in the audience. But the information went nowhere. He served 45 years in prison before being released on parole in 2010. Islam, paroled in 1987, died in 2009. Aziz, 83, was paroled in 1985 and is still alive. The Innocence Project, along with attorney David B. Shanies, have fought to clear Islam&rsquo;s and Aziz&rsquo;s names.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All along, some people have maintained that the FBI and the NYPD were involved in the assassination. Although the agencies viewed Malcolm X as a dangerous Black radical who somehow needed to be brought down, some experts maintain that they did not need to plot to murder the leader because Malcolm X himself had helped make it possible. After leaving the Nation, Malcolm X had ordered his security team not to carry guns and not to search people at the door to the Audubon so as not to deter people from attending his meetings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There was no need for them to get involved with killing Malcolm X. &hellip; They knew the Nation of Islam,&rdquo; Peter Goldman, a former journalist for Newsweek and the author of &ldquo;The Death and Life of Malcolm X,&rdquo; said in an interview with The Washington Post earlier this year. &ldquo;They knew that Muhammad&rsquo;s followers wouldn&rsquo;t be daunted by security or police. They knew that they would walk through walls to do the Nation&rsquo;s bidding.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A 2020 Netflix documentary series, &ldquo;Who Killed Malcolm X?&rdquo; and efforts by the Innocence Project prompted Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. to review the convictions of Aziz and Islam.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Evidence unearthed by Abdur-Rahman Muhammad, a Malcolm X scholar whose search for the true killers was the focus of the documentary, and investigative journalist Les Payne made a compelling case that the actual murderers were members of a Newark mosque, rather than Malcolm X&rsquo;s former Harlem mosque associates Aziz and Islam, who likely would have been quickly recognized in the ballroom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the documentary, a close friend of Newark mosque member William Bradley said Bradley, also known as Al-Mustafa Shabazz, was the man who fired the sawed-off shotgun that killed Malcolm X, echoing Hayer&rsquo;s earlier assertion that Bradley did it. Bradley&rsquo;s alleged role was apparently an open secret in Newark, although Bradley denied it right up to his death in 2018.</p>\r\n', '2022-12-09 04:52:22', 2, 3),
